# QMK firmware for myself

This keymap is made almost entirely from [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). However, I used fewer layers and reduced 36 keys to 34.

> As little as possible, as simple as possible, as easy as possible to memorize

# Keyboards

I have bm40(flank clone)and sweep(ferris clone). This repo contain qmk firmware for that.
