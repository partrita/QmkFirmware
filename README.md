# The 34 keymap for my custom keyboards

This layout is made almost entirely from [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). However, I used fewer layers and reduced 36 keys to 34.

> As little as possible, as simple as possible, as easy as possible to memorize

# Keyboards

I own moonlander, bm40(flank clone)and sweep(ferris clone). Moonlander has there own program which is called oryx but bm40 and sweep is not. This repo contain qmk firmware code for that.

# Layout
